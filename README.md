Currently unavailable for work.  <br>
	
	I have been writing computer software since 1991, mostly in the Clarion language, and	
	have written apps related to the chemical, rental, property management, and
	construction industries. 

Read more about the Clarion language [here](http://www.softvelocity.com/).

## Some of the Applications I've Written	
|Program|Owner|Industry|Description|		
| ---- | ------| ------|------|
|MSDS Master|Self|Chemical|My first commercial app, for simplifying the process of creating Material Safety Data Sheets (no longer active).
|In Back|Self|Productivity|For creating multiple small backups of projects over the course of a work day. www.inback.com (no longer own it).
|Chemical Blender App|Self|Chemical|Chemical product formulation, costing, manufacturing app. Manages raw materials, finished goods, packaging, labeling, inventory. Also handles production batches along with their accompanying raw/finished inventory adjustments. Also creates bills of lading, invoices, and receives payments.
|Party/Linen Rental App|Self|Rental|Maintained inventory of rental products, along with scheduling/availability/return of items. Created invoices, received payments.
|Pager App|Client|Sales|Back in the 90s, when pagers were a thing, I wrote an app that used the TAP protocol to dial up pager services and broadcast a message to multiple pagers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telocator_Alphanumeric_Protocol
|Property Management|Client|Property|Managed maintenance and history of large properties and multiple locations with multiple units.
|Project Management|Client|Construction|Managed entire process of a JOC/SABER construction job, throughout each level of completion.
|Project Estimating|Client (4Clicks/Gordian Group)|Construction|Original developer of the "e4Clicks" Project Estimating program from 2001 until 4Clicks was purchased by The Gordian Group in 2018. During the time of my involvement, program was in use on over 80% of USAF bases and several other government municipalities. Primarily developed for JOC/SABER and IDIQ contracts, this app made extensive use of "pre-priced" costing guides and had a great deal of functionality; such as re-pricing estimates with another pricing guide or applying RSMeans City Cost Index and estimate comparison.
|Fancy Plain Explorer|Self|Graphic Arts|(Currently in development) Among other features, it can generate Automagraphs (a term I invented). Some examples of automagraphs will occasionally be posted at www.twitter.com/automagraph.
|Jumble Lock|Self|Security/Authorization|(Currently in development) Combines 24 1-bit images (such as QR codes) in such a way that you can extract an individual image by using a special code. Each image has its own special code.
|Split Monster|Self|Security|(Currently in development) Performs a binary split of a file, so that none of the portions give a clue what the actual file will contain when re-combined. 

## Skills and Tools
	Although my expertise mostly lies with Clarion, learning new things has always been part of
	my daily regimen. I have studied javascript, typescript, C, C++, golang, HTML5, python, SQL, C#, PowerBasic, and various
	other languages (with varying degrees of strength). 
	
	I have maintained my license with the latest version of Clarion (Currently 11.1 EE) and also 
	have licenses for quite a few 3rd party addons.
	
	I love/prefer to handcode Clarion (with classes), but know how to use appgen and can write 
	templates. I also know the ABC class system pretty well, and even make use of some of those 
	classes (such as PopupClass) in my handcoded apps.
	
	I love to twiddle bits (especially color bits), know how to utilize most non-Clarion 32-bit 
	libraries (such as Windows API) and have also dabbled in MIDI.
	
	
	I use version control on a regular basis and have a few public repositories on [github](https://github.com/jslarve/).
	
## Hire Me
	My typical rate for small jobs is US $120/hr. Depending on the type of work, I can be flexible.
	For longer term jobs, I am open to negotiation.
